      "title": "EVM Data Analysis Fundamentals",
      "content": "Earned Value Management (EVM) data analysis is a core component of IPMDAR reporting and interpretation. Key concepts include:\n\n1. Cost Performance Index (CPI): Measures cost efficiency as the ratio of Earned Value (EV) to Actual Cost (AC)\n2. Schedule Performance Index (SPI): Measures schedule efficiency as the ratio of Earned Value (EV) to Planned Value (PV)\n3. Variance Analysis: Calculation and interpretation of Cost Variance (CV) and Schedule Variance (SV)\n4. Variance at Completion (VAC): Projection of final program cost variance\n\nIPMDAR data analytics requires both calculation of these metrics and meaningful interpretation of what they indicate about program health and trends.",

        "Calculate core EVM metrics from raw IPMDAR data",
        "Interpret EVM performance trends and variances",

      "title": "IPMDAR Data Visualization Techniques",
      "content": "Effective visualization of IPMDAR data transforms raw numbers into actionable insights. Key visualization techniques include:\n\n1. Performance Index Charts: Tracking CPI and SPI over time to identify trends\n2. Variance Charts: Showing CV and SV evolution throughout the program lifecycle\n3. S-Curves: Displaying cumulative planned, earned, and actual costs\n4. Waterfall Charts: Breaking down variances by WBS elements\n5. Heat Maps: Highlighting high-risk or poor-performing areas of the contract\n\nEffective visualizations should provide clear indicators of program health, highlight potential issues, and support decision-making for corrective actions.",

        "Select appropriate visualization techniques for different IPMDAR analysis needs",
        "Create effective visualizations that highlight key performance issues",

      "title": "Statistical Analysis of EVM Data",
      "content": "Statistical techniques enhance the analysis of IPMDAR data by identifying patterns, correlations, and anomalies. Key statistical approaches include:\n\n1. Trend Analysis: Regression techniques to identify performance trends and inflection points\n2. Statistical Process Control: Establishing control limits to identify abnormal performance variations\n3. Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between different performance factors\n4. Anomaly Detection: Statistical methods to identify outliers and unusual patterns\n\nStatistical analysis adds rigor to IPMDAR interpretation, moving beyond simple metric calculation to deeper insights about program performance and potential future trends.",

      "title": "Format 5 Narrative Analysis",
      "content": "The Format 5 Performance Narrative is a critical IPMDAR component that provides context and explanation for the quantitative data. Effective narratives should:\n\n1. Explain significant variances and their root causes\n2. Describe corrective actions and their expected impacts\n3. Identify emerging risks and opportunities\n4. Provide context for data anomalies or unusual patterns\n\nThe Format 5 narrative bridges the gap between quantitative data and management decision-making by explaining what the numbers mean in terms of program execution and future actions.",

        "Analyze Format 5 narratives for completeness and quality",
