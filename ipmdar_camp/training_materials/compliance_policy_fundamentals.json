      "content": "The Defense Acquisition System (DAS) is the management process by which the Department of Defense provides effective, affordable, and timely systems to the users. The DoDI 5000.02 establishes the framework for this process and specifically mandates IPMDAR for Acquisition Category (ACAT) I, IA, and II programs.",

      "content": "The Integrated Program Management Data and Analysis Report (IPMDAR) replaces the legacy Contract Performance Report (CPR) and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) Data Item Descriptions (DIDs). It defines standard formats and data requirements for reporting contract performance data and schedule information on Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition contracts.",
