    {
      "question": "Which calculation method uses both cost and schedule indices to forecast the Estimate at Completion (EAC)?",
      "options": [
        "Cumulative CPI Method",
        "SCI (Schedule Cost Index) Method",
        "BAC Method",
        "ETC Method"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "SCI (Schedule Cost Index) Method",
      "explanation": "The SCI Method combines both the CPI and SPI indices in the formula EAC = BAC / (CPI Ã— SPI) to create a forecast that accounts for both cost and schedule performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of Monte Carlo simulation in IPMDAR risk analysis?",
      "options": [
        "To eliminate the need for risk management",
        "To simulate thousands of possible project outcomes based on probabilistic inputs",
        "To replace traditional EVM metrics",
        "To comply with DoD regulations without meaningful analysis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "To simulate thousands of possible project outcomes based on probabilistic inputs",
      "explanation": "Monte Carlo simulation allows risk analysts to run thousands of simulations with different random variables to generate a probability distribution of possible project outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT typically included in a risk-adjusted EAC?",
      "options": [
        "Known performance variances to date",
        "Probabilistic assessment of identified risks",
        "Contractor profit margins",
        "Management reserve considerations"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Contractor profit margins",
      "explanation": "Contractor profit margins are not typically included in risk-adjusted EACs. These estimates focus on project cost elements affected by performance and risk factors, not contractual profit arrangements."
    },
    {
      "question": "When integrating risk data with EVM in IPMDAR, which approach is considered best practice?",
      "options": [
        "Keeping risk analysis and EVM data completely separate",
        "Replacing EVM data with risk analysis data",
        "Performing quantitative risk assessment only after EVM data shows problems",
        "Integrating risk impacts into EVM forecasts to create risk-adjusted EACs"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Integrating risk impacts into EVM forecasts to create risk-adjusted EACs",
      "explanation": "Best practice involves integrating risk assessment data into EVM forecasts to create comprehensive risk-adjusted EACs that account for both current performance and future risk impacts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correct interpretation of an 80% confidence level in a risk-adjusted schedule?",
      "options": [
        "There is an 80% chance the project will finish early",
        "There is an 80% chance the project will finish on the estimated completion date or earlier",
        "At least 80% of project tasks will be completed on time",
        "The schedule has been padded with 80% additional time"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "There is an 80% chance the project will finish on the estimated completion date or earlier",
      "explanation": "An 80% confidence level means there is an 80% probability that the project will complete on or before the estimated completion date, based on the risk analysis performed."
