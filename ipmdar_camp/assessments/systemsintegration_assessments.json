    {
      "question": "What is the primary data format structure used for IPMDAR submissions?",
      "options": [
        "XML",
        "CSV",
        "JSON",
        "YAML"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "JSON",
      "explanation": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the primary data format structure used for IPMDAR submissions, providing a flexible, hierarchical format for organizing program performance data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which integration pattern is most appropriate for processing large volumes of IPMDAR data asynchronously?",
      "options": [
        "Point-to-Point Integration",
        "Message Queue Processing",
        "Remote Procedure Calls",
        "Database Replication"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Message Queue Processing",
      "explanation": "Message Queue Processing is the most appropriate integration pattern for handling large volumes of IPMDAR data asynchronously, allowing systems to process data at their own pace without blocking operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should be synchronized between EVM and IPMDAR systems to ensure consistent performance reporting?",
      "options": [
        "Contractor personnel records",
        "Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)",
        "Government oversight team structure",
        "System architecture diagrams"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)",
      "explanation": "The Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) should be synchronized between EVM and IPMDAR systems to ensure that performance is measured and reported consistently against the same baseline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT typically part of an IPMDAR data architecture?",
      "options": [
        "Data element definitions",
        "Relationship mapping between WBS and OBS",
        "Hardware infrastructure specifications",
        "Data validation rules"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Hardware infrastructure specifications",
      "explanation": "Hardware infrastructure specifications are implementation details rather than part of the IPMDAR data architecture, which focuses on data structure, relationships, formats, and validation rules."
    },
    {
      "question": "When designing system interfaces for IPMDAR, which approach provides the most flexibility for future changes?",
      "options": [
        "Tightly coupled point-to-point interfaces",
        "Direct database connections between systems",
        "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)",
        "Manual data re-entry between systems"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)",
      "explanation": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) provides the most flexibility for future changes by creating modular, loosely-coupled services that can be modified independently without affecting the entire system."
