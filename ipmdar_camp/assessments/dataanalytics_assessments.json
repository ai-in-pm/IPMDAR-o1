    {
      "question": "What does a Cost Performance Index (CPI) of 0.85 indicate about a program?",
      "options": [
        "The program is 15% ahead of schedule",
        "The program is performing at 85% of the planned cost efficiency",
        "The program has used 85% of its budget",
        "The program is 15% behind schedule"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The program is performing at 85% of the planned cost efficiency",
      "explanation": "A CPI of 0.85 means that for every dollar spent, the program is earning only $0.85 in value, indicating cost inefficiency of 15%."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which visualization technique best shows the cumulative planned value, earned value, and actual cost over time?",
      "options": [
        "Bar chart",
        "Scatter plot",
        "S-curve",
        "Pie chart"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "S-curve",
      "explanation": "S-curves display cumulative values over time and are ideally suited for showing the relationship between planned value, earned value, and actual cost throughout a program."
    },
    {
      "question": "When analyzing a Format 5 narrative report, which of the following would be considered a deficiency?",
      "options": [
        "Detailed explanation of root causes for significant variances",
        "Description of specific corrective actions with expected completion dates",
        "General statement that 'all variances are being addressed'",
        "Analysis of potential impacts of current variances on final outcomes"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "General statement that 'all variances are being addressed'",
      "explanation": "Vague, general statements without specific details about variance causes, corrective actions, and expected impacts are a deficiency in Format 5 reporting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What statistical technique would be most appropriate for determining if a recent performance change represents a significant trend versus normal variation?",
      "options": [
        "Simple averaging",
        "Statistical Process Control (SPC)",
        "Pie chart analysis",
        "Nominal Group Technique"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Statistical Process Control (SPC)",
      "explanation": "Statistical Process Control (SPC) establishes control limits that help differentiate between normal variation in performance and significant changes that represent actual trends."
    },
    {
      "question": "A program's CPI has been 0.92, 0.91, 0.89, 0.87, and 0.84 over the past five reporting periods. What does this trend most likely indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The program is becoming progressively more cost efficient",
        "The program is experiencing gradually worsening cost performance",
        "The program is maintaining stable cost performance",
        "The program is improving its schedule performance"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The program is experiencing gradually worsening cost performance",
      "explanation": "The declining CPI values (from 0.92 to 0.84) indicate a program that is becoming progressively less cost-efficient over time, showing a negative trend in cost performance."
